# Game Hub - Agent Documentation

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Game Hub  
**Platform:** Mobile (iOS & Android)  
**Tech Stack:** React Native, Expo Go (SDK 51+), TypeScript  
**Context:** Mobile Development Midterm Project — DAUST

Game Hub is a mobile application that lets users play 4 classic board games in a single app. Each game supports two modes: Player vs Player (local) and Player vs Computer (with 3 AI difficulty levels).

## Games Included

| # | Game | Type | Board Size |
|---|------|------|------------|
| 1 | 3 Pions | Senegalese strategy | 3×3 grid (9 positions) |
| 2 | Tic Tac Toe | Classic | 3×3 grid |
| 3 | Checkers | Classic strategy | 8×8 board |
| 4 | Chess | Classic strategy | 8×8 board |

---

## Game Modes

### Player vs Player (PvP)
- Two human players take turns on the same device
- Players are labeled Player 1 and Player 2
- A visual indicator shows whose turn it is

### Player vs Computer (PvC)
- The human plays as Player 1, the computer as Player 2
- The user selects a difficulty level before starting the game
- The computer takes its turn automatically after the player's move (with 600ms delay)

### AI Difficulty Levels

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Easy | Random valid moves. No strategic lookahead. |
| Medium | Looks 1–2 moves ahead. Prioritizes winning/blocking moves. |
| Hard | Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. Plays near-optimally. |

## Key Implementation Rules

1. **Never mutate state directly.** Always create new state objects/arrays
2. **All game logic must live in `utils/`**, not inside components
3. **Each game's board component receives only props** — no direct store access
4. **TypeScript strict mode is on.** No `any` types allowed
5. **Handle edge cases:** AI must never make an illegal move
6. **Expo Go compatibility:** All animations use react-native-reanimated

## Current Implementation Status

- ✅ Project configuration (package.json, app.json, tsconfig.json, babel.config.js)
- ✅ Types and constants
- ✅ Zustand store
- ✅ Shared UI components (Button, Card, Modal, PlayerInfo, TurnIndicator)
- ✅ Game boards (TicTacToe, TroisPions, Checkers, Chess)

## Notes for Development

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
2. Run `npx expo start` to start the development server
3. Use Expo Go app on mobile to test
4. All game logic is implemented in the `utils/` folder
5. Board components are in `components/games/`
6. Screens use Expo Router file-based navigation
